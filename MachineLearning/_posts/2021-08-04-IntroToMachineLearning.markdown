Thanks to mine being a student at National University of Colombia, I've been granted access to a set of Coursera specializations. I decided to take the Advanced Machine Learning Specialization, since I want to be able to understand the basics of this filed, and how to apply it to the study of quantum systems.

> At this stage, My knowledge of Machine learning is pretty basic. I haven't worked with any python framework, nor have I went beyond simple linear fits in my lab classes.

In this blog, I will summarize my learning process and also some perspectives and exercises I might probably encounter in the journey. Today, I start with the first course: **Introduction to Deep Learning from HSE**.

## Course Intro

This course has the following prerequisites:

1. Machine Learning Basics
1. Probability theory
1. Linear Algebra
1. Calculus

Most of them I have in decent amount, except for Machine Learning. The structure is as follows

| Week |                                Topics                                 |
| :--: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  1   |         Linear Models: Separating data classes using a plane          |
|  2   | Multi-Layer Perceptron: Separating classes with non-linear boundaries |
|  3   |       Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Image processing       |
|  4   |         Working with neural representations: Encoding images          |
|  5   |                  Recurrent Neural Networks and text                   |
|  6   |                  Training an image captioning model                   |

Basically, since model training requires a huge amount of computational resources, I will use **Google Colab** for all the assignments and exercises. At least while I can get my hands on a PC with a powerful enough GPU.
